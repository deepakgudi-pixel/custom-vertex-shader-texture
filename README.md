<p>Custom vertex shader and fragment shader with loaded texture  which can used in any javascript framework  and texture can load any images<p>
  
<p>You can specify two different types of shaders for each material: <p>

<li>The vertex shader runs first; it receives attributes, calculates / manipulates the position of each individual vertex, and passes additional data (varyings) to the fragment shader.</li>
<li>The fragment ( or pixel ) shader runs second; it sets the color of each individual "fragment" (pixel) rendered to the screen.</li>
<br>
 <strong><em>Noise</em></strong>
  
  <li>Noise is an indispensable tool for creative coding. We use it to generate all kinds of organic effects like clouds, landscapes and contours. Or to move and distort objects with a more lifelike behaviour.</li>
  
<br>
 
<strong><em>UV</em></strong>
  <li>UVs are two-dimensional texture coordinates that correspond with the vertex information for your geometry. UVs are vital because they provide the link between a surface mesh and how an image texture gets applied onto that surface.</li>
